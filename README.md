<h1>Modular Trinkets</h1>

A repository for a Minecraft Mod I'm working on, called Modular Trinkets. A huge W.I.P. at the moment.

**<u>About Project Concept:</u>**

- Modular Trinkets adds many new trinkets/accessories to the game, wearable in Baubles slots, that give the player a unique look and feel, while also providing protection against damage and more. There are trinkets like Crowns, Amulets, Chains, Bracelets, Anklets, Belts, Masks and so on.

- Each trinket can be handcrafted by the player by choosing a base metal as the base material for the trinket. Each base material will have its own Durability Modifier, and Potency Modifier, and can be embedded with gems as per the choice of the player, making the trinkets completely modular.

- The mod aims to provide a fun way of dealing with armor accessories, while giving the player freedom of choice to craft their trinkets in an optimally personalised manner, and at the same time providing functionality for the player's adventures.

<u><b>Working Principles:</b></u>

- Durability Modifier determines how much durability a certain trinket type will have, decided by the base material used. For example, if Crowns have a base durability of 300 points, and the player uses a material with a Durability Modifier of 0.5x, the Crown finally crafted will have a Durability of 150 points.
- Each Trinket has a given number of slots. In these slots, the player can choose to embed Gems. Each gem, like Diamond, Emerald, Amethyst, and the likes, will have its own unique attribute that will determine the type of additional effect provided by the Trinket. For example, embedding the trinket's slots with Diamond increases physical damage reduction.
- Potency Modifier of a material thus defines how potent the additional effects provided by the embedded gems are. For example, if a single Diamond embed on a Crown provides +15% physical damage reduction, and the Crown material has a Potency Modifier of 1.5x, the additional damage reduction provided by a single Diamond embed on that crown becomes 22.5%
- Each material in the game, across different mods, will have a unique combination of these modifiers.
- Compatibility with other major mods is planned.
- Any custom ores or materials added natively will be OreDict-friendly.

**<u>Project Goal:</u>**

- To create a unique experience for players to deal with armor and cosmetics both together.
- To implement support with other major mods and the resources they add, in order to expand the applications of the trinkets.
- Most importantly, a learning experience for me. This is my first project, an ambitious one too, but I do wish to take it as far as I can.
